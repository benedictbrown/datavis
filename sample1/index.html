            This page is intended to illustrate some simple javascript usage.
            It's not a full tutorial, but shows off a few features and quirks,
            as well as a bit about how javascript interacts with web pages.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Press Ctrl-U/Cmd-U to see the HTML source for this page.
                You'll see that it doesn't include the parts
                for setting a custom red/green/blue color.  That is
                added dynamically by javascript code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open the developer tools and select the Elements tab to see
                the structure of the HTML file after it has been modified
                by javascript.  Look for the &lt;input&gt; elements that
                were added by javascript code to specify a custom red/green/blue color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the Sources pane to see (and debug) the javascript code as well as the HTML and CSS.
                Pay attention to which parts of this page below the horizontal line are specified in
                each file.
            </li>
            <li>Use the Console pane to see any errors and the output of <tt>console.log()</tt>statements.</li>
            <li>Use the Network pane to see network requests, including the information that is sent to the server and the responses received.</li>
        </ul>

            Change the circle's color to
            <button type="button" onclick="setSVGColor('red')">red</button>, 
            <button type="button" onclick="setSVGColor('green')">green</button>, or
            <button type="button" onclick="setSVGColor('blue')">blue</button>.
            <span id="custom-color"></span>
        </p>

        <p><button type="button" onclick="hideCircle()" id="hide-circle-button">Click here</button> to hide the circle for 5 seconds.</p>

            The figure below is a black circle and a black rectange.
            Even though you don't see it in the HTML, there is a 
            gray background, and the circle has a chartreuse border.
            Those effects are defined in CSS in index.css, just to
            illustrate that you can control SVG via both attributes and CSS.
        -->

                 filters, and positioning to the entire group -->
